                                DEEP LEARNING PROJECT - STORY TELLING BOT               ▕⃝⃤

For the past years, the feeling of loneliness has become more important in our society due to the lockdown induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, many of us have find comfort in reading books. However, this comfort was only short-lived as many of the books ending left us on cliff-hangers or maybe unsatisfied regarding the love story of the main characters. Therefore, a solution to this problem would be to create a story telling bot (**SBOT** for short) that would allow us to extrapolate the rest of the story or even feed our imagination with an unlikely romance between the main and some background characters. In fact, who has never wanted to know more about the forbidden love between Harry Potter and Dobby the house elf ? Or maybe explore the day to day life of Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger as a married couple ?



> Authors : **Victor Mangeleer**, **Axelle Schyns** and **Lucie Navez**
